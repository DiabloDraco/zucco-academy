                A company profile will differentiate your brand.
                A company profile will naturally describe what makes your company unique. It will automatically differentiate your brand because no other company has the exact same founding story and reason for existing that you do. Your history and values are integral parts of a brand positioning strategy, and a company profile is the one place where you can mention these pieces of information without it feeling extraneous or out-of-place.

                A company profile may justify a higher price point.
                If you go into detail about your production values or ethically sourced materials, you may be able to justify a higher price point for your products and services. For instance, Starbucks’ coffee may not necessarily be better than Dunkin’ Donuts’ coffee — but because Starbucks goes into detail about its high-quality ingredients, it immediately creates the sense that you’ll be paying a premium for its goods.

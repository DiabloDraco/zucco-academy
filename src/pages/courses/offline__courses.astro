                  A company profile will differentiate your brand. A company
                  profile will naturally describe what makes your company
                  unique. It will automatically differentiate your brand because
                  no other company has the exact same founding story and reason
                  for existing that you do. Your history and values are integral
                  parts of a brand positioning strategy, and a company profile
                  is the one place where you can mention these pieces of
                  information without it feeling extraneous or out-of-place. A
                  company profile may justify a higher price point. If you go
                  into detail about your production values or ethically sourced
                  materials, you may be able to justify a higher price point for
                  your products and services. For instance, Starbucks’ coffee
                  may not necessarily be better than Dunkin’ Donuts’ coffee —
                  but because Starbucks goes into detail about its high-quality
                  ingredients, it immediately creates the sense that you’ll be
                  paying a premium for its goods.
